# Our Wedding Moments - A Shared Photo Gallery

Welcome to "Our Wedding Moments," a beautiful, self-hosted, and mobile-first photo gallery designed for sharing cherished memories from a special day. This project allows wedding guests to easily upload their captured moments and view a collective album of photos from everyone who attended. It also includes a simple, password-protected admin panel for managing the gallery content.

This project is built with **PHP** and requires no database, making it incredibly lightweight and easy to set up on any standard web server.

## Key Features

This gallery is packed with features designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for both guests and administrators.

### üñºÔ∏è Guest & User Experience
* **Elegant & Personal Header:** A beautifully designed header featuring the couple's names and a welcome message, fully optimized for mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Parallax Background:** Subtle, animated background elements create a delightful and immersive atmosphere.
* **Responsive Photo Grid:** The gallery displays all photos in a responsive grid that looks great on any screen size, from phones to desktops.
* **Interactive Modal Viewer:** Clicking on any photo opens it in a full-screen modal, allowing guests to view images in high detail.
    * **Easy Navigation:** Guests can navigate between photos using on-screen arrows or keyboard keys.
    * **Click-Outside-to-Close:** The modal can be closed by clicking the background or pressing the 'Escape' key.
    * **In-Modal Actions:** Users can download the currently viewed photo directly from the modal.
* **Seamless Multi-Photo Uploader:** An intuitive drag-and-drop (or click) uploader allows guests to select and upload multiple photos at once.
* **Multi-Select Download:** Guests can enable a "multi-select" mode to choose several photos from the gallery grid and download them all in a single action.
* **User-Friendly Notifications:** Non-intrusive "toast" notifications confirm successful uploads or provide feedback on actions.
* **Clean URLs:** The gallery uses `.htaccess` to provide clean, user-friendly URLs (e.g., `yourwebsite.com/` instead of `yourwebsite.com/index.php`).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Admin Features
* **Password-Protected Login:** A simple modal provides access to the admin functions, secured by a single, easy-to-change password.
* **Conditional UI:** The main "Share Moments" upload button is hidden when the admin is logged in, preventing confusion.
* **Single Photo Deletion:** Admins can delete individual photos directly from the gallery grid or within the full-screen modal viewer.
* **Multi-Photo Deletion:** The "multi-select" mode allows admins to choose and delete multiple photos at once, with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.
* **Clear Logout:** A visible "Admin Logout" button allows for securely ending the admin session.

### üöÄ Technical Features
* **Automatic Thumbnail Generation:** On upload, the application automatically creates smaller, optimized thumbnails for each photo. This ensures the main gallery page loads quickly, improving performance.
* **Lightweight & Server-Friendly:** Built with plain PHP, it runs on almost any web server with PHP support and does not require a database.
* **Secure File Handling:** Uses `basename()` to sanitize file paths during uploads and deletions to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Configuration

Setting up your own "Wedding Moments" gallery is simple.

1.  **Upload Files:** Place the `index.php` and `.htaccess` files in the root directory of your web server.
2.  **Create Directories:** Create two folders in the same directory:
    * `images/` - This is where the full-resolution uploaded photos will be stored.
    * `thumbnails/` - This is where the auto-generated thumbnails will be stored.
    * **Important:** Ensure both directories have write permissions (e.g., `chmod 755` or `chmod 777`, depending on your server configuration) so that the PHP script can save files.
3.  **Set Your Admin Password:** Open the `index.php` file and change the password on this line:
    ```php
    $adminPassword = 'admin123'; // Change this password!
    ```
4.  **Customize Content (Optional):**
    * To change the names and welcome message, edit the content within the `<div class="header">` section in `index.php`.
    * You can replace the placeholder image URL in the header with a real photo of the couple.
